# Human-in-the-Loop Voice AI Agent

This project is a locally running prototype of a human-in-the-loop AI system that interacts with customers over phone calls. It escalates queries to a human supervisor when it doesn't know the answer, follows up with the customer, and updates its internal knowledge base accordingly.

## ðŸ”§ Functionalities

### 1. AI Agent Setup (via LiveKit)
- Simulated AI agent initialized with basic business info about a fake salon.
- Handles incoming calls using LiveKit.
- Responds to known questions directly.
- Triggers an event for unknown queries when human assistance is needed.

### 2. Human Request Handling
- Creates a structured help request to human supervisor.
- Simulates notifying a supervisor via console logs and webhooks

### 3. Supervisor Response Interface
- Web-based UI for supervisors to:
  - View all pending help requests
  - Submit answers to queries
  
- Once answered:
  - AI sends follow-up to original caller.
  - Answer is saved to the knowledge base of the voice AI agent.
